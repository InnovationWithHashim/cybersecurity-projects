# Wireshark Traffic Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing network traffic using Wireshark.  
I used sample PCAP files to identify scanning attempts, protocol flows, and suspicious activity.

## Tools Used
- Wireshark
- Public PCAP datasets

## PCAP Sources
- https://wiki.wireshark.org/SampleCaptures
- https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net

## Key Tasks Performed
- Loaded sample PCAPs into Wireshark
- Detected SYN scanning patterns
- Analyzed HTTP, TCP, and DNS traffic
- Extracted important indicators of compromise (IOCs)

## Findings Summary
(Add your simple notes here, for example:)
- Found multiple failed connection attempts (possible scan)
- Detected HTTP GET requests from suspicious IPs
- Observed unusual DNS lookup behavior

## Skills Learned
- Packet inspection
- Network protocol understanding
- Identifying scanning behavior
- Basic traffic analysis
