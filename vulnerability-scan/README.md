Vulnerability Scan Project Report
1. Project Title

Vulnerability Assessment with Nessus Essentials

2. Introduction

Vulnerability scanning is a core part of cybersecurity. It identifies weaknesses in systems that could be exploited by attackers. Nessus Essentials is a free version of Nessus that allows beginners to scan up to 16 IPs for vulnerabilities.

This project demonstrates scanning a test system to find vulnerabilities and document remediation steps.

3. Objectives

Scan a system for vulnerabilities using Nessus Essentials

Identify CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)

Understand severity levels and risk scoring

Document remediation recommendations

4. Tools & Environment

Nessus Essentials: Free vulnerability scanner (https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials
